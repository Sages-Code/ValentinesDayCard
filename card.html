                <p>Happy Valentine's Day Sugar! I wanted to make you something, because I don't think we're in that part of our friendship where we can share our addys quite yet. Otherwise I would've sent you flowers alongside Rob and su so, I thought I'd put my college classes to use and make you a card and flowers.</p>
                <p>I'm sorry it's not much, but I wanted to say thank you for being yourself! I genuinely enjoy your company and talking with you even if I randomly go mute at times haha! Spending time with you is always enjoyable and I hope we get to know each other more! Be sure to treat yourself today if you haven't already.</p>
                <p>Much love - Sage!</p>
